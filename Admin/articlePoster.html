          Choose the csv file you want to upload: <input name="fileName" type="file"/>

         The csv file should use | as a delimiter instead of a comma. It should also be stripped of the heading row.<br>
         There shouldn't be any |'s in the text other than the delimiters.<br>
         For Online articles, each row is expected to begin with http.<br>
	Local articles haven't been implemented yet. It's just a matter of choosing a standard delimiter for each row to begin with <br>.
